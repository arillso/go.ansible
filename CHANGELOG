and [human-readable changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

- **Renaming and Refactoring of the Main Structure:**
  - The previous structure **`AnsiblePlaybook`** has been removed and replaced with the new **`Playbook`** structure.
  This change requires updates in any code that previously referenced `AnsiblePlaybook`.

- **Changed Method Signature:**
  - The **`Exec`** method now requires a `context.Context` parameter. Existing calls without this context will no longer work.

- **Reorganization of the `Config` Struct:**
  - The configuration structure has been reorganized. Many fields have been added, renamed, or grouped
  into categories (General, SSH, Playbook, Vault, Facts, Galaxy, etc.). As a result, existing configurations
  must be updated (e.g., options such as `User`, `AskPass`, `SyntaxCheck`, and various Galaxy-related parameters are now structured differently).

### Added

- **Extended Configuration Options:**
  - New fields added to the `Config` struct for SSH, Vault, Facts, and Galaxy integration (`PrivateKey`, `VaultPassword`, `GalaxyAPIServerURL`, `GalaxyCollectionsPath`, etc.).
  - Additional parameters such as `CallbackWhitelist`, `PollInterval`, `GatherSubset`, and `StrategyPlugin`.

- **New Helper Functions:**
  - Added functions:
    - `resolvePlaybooks` for resolving file patterns.
    - `prepareTempFiles` and `cleanupTempFiles` for managing temporary files.
    - Utility functions for command construction (`applyOption`, `addVerbose`, `appendExtraVars`).

- **Improved Test Coverage:**
  - Comprehensive unit tests for new functionalities including playbook resolution, temporary file handling, environment variable management, and command building.

### Changed

- **Command Building and Execution:**
  - Implemented a new approach for building commands (`ansible-playbook` and `ansible-galaxy`) using context-based calls (`exec.CommandContext`)
  and dynamically setting environment variables.
  - Enhanced error handling utilizing the `github.com/pkg/errors` package.

- **Documentation and Code Comments:**
  - Updated and expanded documentation within the codebase and README to clearly reflect new features and API changes.

- **Go Version Update:**
  - Updated Go version in `go.mod` from **1.18** to **1.23**.

### Removed

- **Deprecated Files and Structures:**
  - Removed **`.all-contributorsrc`** file.
  - Deleted test playbook file **`tests/test.yml`**.

- **Redundant Code:**
  - Cleaned up outdated variables, comments, and redundant code segments.
